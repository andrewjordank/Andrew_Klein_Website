# Current Projects #
**Dr. Karnes' Lab**

Worked on data analysis and generating for an ABO Systematic review. This was my first introduction to R, Python, and Linux programming languages.
Currently, I am working on gathering preliminary background research on the disease heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT). My dissertation will be on this disease and while I do not have concrete aims at the moment, I have about 10 potential aims. I am working closely with collaborators, other lab members, and my PI to narrow my aims.

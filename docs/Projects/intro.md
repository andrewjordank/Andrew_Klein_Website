# Current Projects #
** Dr. Karnes' Lab **
Worked on data analysis and generating for an ABO Systematic review. This was my first introduction into R, Python, and Linux programing languages.
Currently I am working on gathering preliminary background research on the disease heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). My dissertation will be on this disease and while I do not have concreteaims at the moment, I have about 10 potential aims. I am working closely with collaborators, other lab members, and my PI to narrow my aims.

My name is Andrew Klein and I’ve lived in Tucson all my life. I recently graduated from the U of A with a bachelors in physiology and a minor in biochemistry. After doing classical genetic research for 5 years, I’ve found myself in the pharmacy department. I’m currently pursuing a doctoral degree in genetics while working in Dr. Karnes’ lab. After doing classical genetic research for 5 years, I now study pharmacogenetics focusing on the disease heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This lab has required me to learn how to code and manage sensitive data.
